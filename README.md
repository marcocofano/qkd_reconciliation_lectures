# QKD Reconciliation Lectures

![Build Status](https://github.com/marcocofano/qkd_reconciliation_lectures/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

A series of lectures on the reconciliation of QKD.

> [!NOTE] This series of lectures are a work in progress. Please refer to this readme the changelog and the release
> notes for updates on its status

The lectures span several topics like

- Shannon theory of communication
- Modern error correction, Low Density Parity Check Codes, Decoding and Encoding
- QKD protocols, classical reconciliation and security proofs
- Privacy amplification and randomness extraction

## Syllabus

### Lecture 0 - Source Coding

### Lecture 1 - Channel Coding

### Lecture 2 - Linear Codes

### Lecture 3 - Decoding

### Lecture 4 - QKD ErrorCorrection I. QKD protocols overview

### Lecture 5 - QKD ErrorCorrection II. Error correction in DV and CV protocols

### Lecture 6 - QKD ErrorCorrection III. Validation and $$\epsilon$$-security

### Lecture 7 - Privacy amplification I. Theory

### Lecture 8 - Privacy amplification II. Implementations

## Codes

The folder codes contains sample scripts and libraries mentioned in the lecture content. Refer to the [[codes/readme.md]] file to understand how to run them 

## Slides

A collection of slides for various presentations during classes.

The source code for the slides is developed using slidev. Slidev is a tool to create interactive slides using js and
markdown, it supports latex, code, renders images, slide effects. It also allows for interactive handling of the slides
from the browser with tooling like presenter mode, live content changes, pencils, live video recording (with thumbnail
video of the presenter) and much more.
